## Infor Book Store
A fictional book store for demo purposes

## Assumptions
* File is fixed length using space instead of tab as tab can have variable length.
* Since import function is typically used in scheduling, more time has been spent on backend
to process the import and the web page is for demo purposes only
* If more time is given, we can do more enhancement in the Web layer, e.g. using Angular to display the imported books

## Development Process
I have taken a typical approach for development of this coding exercise in which I started with the fundamental layer and built up layer by layer. The data layer was built first, followed by Connectors module and Business Layer. The presentation layer was built last and as a result I didn't have enough time to put my best into it.
