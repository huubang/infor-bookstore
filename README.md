## Infor Book Store
A fictional book store for demo purposes

## Assumptions
* File is fixed length using space instead of tab as tab can have variable length.
* Since import function is typically used in scheduling, more time has been spent on backend
to process the import and the web page is for demo purposes only
* If more time is given, we can do more enhancement in the Web layer, e.g. using Angular to display the imported books
